# brute-force
Ideas for doing brute-force and stress-testing during competitive programming.
- [ ] How does this work?
- [ ] Write a/serveral test scripts in fish shell script, referencing to [Errichito's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXTVOyQpSGM) and Coursera's [CC course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/competitive-programming-core-skills/lecture/70ymh/stress-testing), learn fish shell script on the go.
- [ ] Try this out in at least 5 real problems at Codeforces.
