# brute-force
Ideas for doing brute-force and stress-testing during competitive programming.
- [x] How does this work?
- [x] Write a/serveral test scripts ~in fish shell script~, referencing to [Errichito's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXTVOyQpSGM) and Coursera's [CC course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/competitive-programming-core-skills/lecture/70ymh/stress-testing)~, learn fish shell script on the go.~ (it turns out I do not need to write fish scripts for this)
- [x] No, but how this really works? Check out https://ali-ibrahim137.github.io/competitive/programming/2020/08/23/Stress-Testing.html
- [ ] Try this out in at least 5 real problems at Codeforces.
