CF 742 A https://codeforces.com/contest/742/problem/A

Generator - Give a random number n (0 <= n <= 10^9)

Brute force solution - A funny way to do this is to actually calculate 1378 raised to the power of n, a better brute force is to calculate 8 raised to the power of n, since 137 is not relevent to the last digit.
